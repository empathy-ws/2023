											<h2>Overview</h2>

											<p>Nowadays the spreading of low-cost technologies integrating sensors and actuators favors the development of the so-called smart objects, a trend fostered by the Internet of Things (IoT), 
											   which creates a bridge between the physical and the digital world thanks to ubiquitous, connected sensors and actuators.

												The opportunities offered by the IoT are amplified by the use of new approaches that, based on novel interaction paradigms, involve directly non-technical users in configuring the behavior of their smart objects. 
												End-User Development (EUD) is defined as a set of methods, techniques, and tools that allow users of software systems, who are acting as non-professional software developers, to create, modify, or extend a software artifact. 
												To support EUD of IoT applications, we have to consider that only end-users can know the most appropriate ways their applications should react to contextual events.
												Thus, to reach a broad variety of users, tailoring environments should offer an easy-to-learn User Interface (UI), while allowing users to attain high value and even complexity of the software they create or customize. 
												In this way, it will be possible to obtain faster tailoring, better control over the application functionality, and improved user experiences.

												Among the results that have benefited from the EUD approach, there are systems for configuring and assigning semantics to intelligent objects also using pattern recognition techniques and interactive treasure hunt experiences through IoT smart objects and augmented cultural artifacts within cultural sites. 
												Another promising field in which EUD may have potential is education. Optimal integration of IoT devices in the educational setting is closely associated with empowering children to program their smart games and providing educators with the possibility of defining each learner's curricula.

												Moreover, the use of IoT devices can pose significant security and privacy risks to end-users. In fact, the large amount of sensitive data the devices can collect and make available makes them an attractive target for malicious individuals thus, it is necessary to provide end-users with tailored EUD solutions for protecting their security.
												In addition, the end-user's mental model lacks, among other aspects, the capacity to recognize whether their interaction with EUD can lead to severe security and privacy risks. 

												It is essential to educate users on the potential risks associated with the use of IoT devices in EUDs.
												With the aim of supporting users at making better decisions when configuring an IoT-based environment, an alternative or complementary approach to education lies in the provisioning of personalized recommendations. In fact, it has long been demonstrated that recommendations can improve system usability and user experience in the EUD domain: for example, they can help to make the design space more manageable by suggesting IF-THEN rules which fit the end users' goals, possibly taking into account also factors, such as personality traits, which could impact the perception, acceptance and appreciation of recommendations themselves.

												Furthermore, it is to be considered how well the different composition paradigms that the tailoring systems implement can support the end-user activities on these platforms. For instance, approaches based on conversational agents or augmented reality seem promising for designing more engaging and understandable rule creation tools.</p>

											<p> This will be a one-day workshop, oriented towards discussions, hands-on
												sessions, and presentations. We invite submissions of two types: short papers (3-4 pages) and
												position papers (1-2 pages). Participants are asked to submit their
												paper describing their recent or future work in one of the areas
												indicated in the topics of interest. All submissions must be in the
												"1-column CEURART" template, available at the following links:
